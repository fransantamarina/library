TO DO

-- Add cross to 'clean' search instead of clean button
-- Create Customer profile view
-- loan-list should redirect to customer profile when clicking on his/her name
-- Protect loans route for admin and user : when a user is logged in, only show his/her own loans
-- In loan-list view, instead of 'New' button, render loan details if role equals USER
-- Customer can only have one loan(in customer view with role USER, new loan must change view current loan)
-- Implement delete button for everything (protect route -only for admin-)
-- Send email when signin up
-- Load book cover img (save URL)
-- Load profile pic (user -save URL-)
-- Sort tables
-- change date format in loan view (only what's rendered)

BUGS

DONE

-- Add errorMessage to templates
-- Check if when an entity instance is retrieved and modified it's necessary to save it again (NOT NECESSARY)
-- Check if @PutMapping will work on regular controller when "activating" an entity instance(NEEDS REST CONTROLLER)
-- Added empty list message to templates

-- Loan can't start before current day
-- Loan must end automatically in endDate (turn active to false, show message in view)
-- Remove New Loan button
-- Separate getAll and getAllActive in every service class
-- When editing a customer it creates a new one instead of editing the one on display(FIXED --> on template, added 
    input type="hidden" and passed the existing customer's id back to the controller)
-- When clicking on new Publisher it redirects to new Loan(FIXED -> fixed the route on NavBar)
-- When clicking on new Customer and new Loan, there's a white label error(FIXED -> corrected url in view)
-- When creating a new loan from customers view, it says "pick a customer and try again", check form and controller(FIXED -> passed back customerId from exception control)
